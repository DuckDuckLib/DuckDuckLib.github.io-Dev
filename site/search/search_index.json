Tips, Tricks, and How to Use the Search Engine (Jan 27, 2021) Note: If you decide to look for more information, remember to make sure the articles you are reading are recent. In researching I found a lot of writing from 2 or 3 years ago which may not reflect the current state of affairs. When it comes to techy kinds of things, the older information is, the more due diligence is required before trusting it. Why did you write ~5000 pages of documentation for such a simple extension? Answer #1: Nobody was born knowing anything Things that seem simple to one person might be at the bleeding edge of another\u2019s capabilities Maybe someone will read something a bit more than they were expecting and be inspired to curiosity; that has certainly happened to me lots of times Answer #2: For my own benefit I wanted to learn about and practice creating documentation, since I\u2019ve never done it before and am interested in contributing more to Free Software in this way. I have often noticed deficits in documentation in projects I\u2019m interested in making use of. It\u2019s difficult to get into an existing project to help it out because there are existing structures, histories, and reasons why things happened the way they did. Also, if my problem is that I can\u2019t understand how something works, then I can\u2019t very well do much to fix it. So when it occurred to me to make this extremely simple extension, I thought I would try to do a really good job at documentation, to see what it\u2019s like. I have to say it was much, much more difficult than I anticipated. The name is silly. I am not very good at naming things. I wanted to keep the DuckDuck part of DuckDuckGo because it is recognizable.

Private browsing does not protect web activity from being discovered by others as well as you may think! That\u2019s it, the extension is now installed! Using DuckDuckLib search extension Method 1: Through the Location bar This extension will take effect when you do a websearch through the browser .

However, it is possible to change this to get two separate boxes. In that case, DuckDuckLib will work via the search box. Method 2: In the New Tab search box DuckDuckLib will be effective via the new tab (blank page). By default, a new page or tab should look a bit like the below. Type in the box (with blue border), to the left of the magnifying glass When you have entered you search term, press Enter or Return on your keyboard, or press the \u2192 arrow to proceed with search.
