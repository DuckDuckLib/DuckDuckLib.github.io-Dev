If you feel compelled to reach out to me, I am happy to hear from you. 

## About technical problems, suggestions, ideas

I have extremely limited technical expertise. It was a bit of a stretch for me to construct this extension and website. I would advise you *limit* your expectations regarding my capacity to make improvements. I am happy to collect thoughts until such time as either I am able to act on them, or someone else comes along who is able to do so. (Neither of which being at all inevitable.)

If you would like to make any direct improvements, you are of course welcome to  make a proposal, or fork üçΩÔ∏è.

## Feedback on the documentation

I'm only slightly more skilled at creating documentation than I am at creating computer programs. What do you think of my efforts? Too much? *Too little?* Wrong focus? Or what?
