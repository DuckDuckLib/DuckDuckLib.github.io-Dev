## ~~What the heck do I care about Privacy Policies anyway?~~

~~I know, I know. If you want to get into the muck of it, [“Terms of Service; Didn't Read” (short: ToS;DR)](http://tosdr.org/en/about) is a good place to start~~

> ~~We are a user rights [initiative](http://tosdr.org/about) to [rate and label](http://tosdr.org/classification) website terms & privacy policies, from very good Class A to very bad Class E.~~
>
> ~~Terms of service are often **too long to read**,  but it's important to understand what's in them. Your rights online  depend on them. We hope that our ratings can help you get informed about your rights.~~

~~They even have their own [browser extensions](http://tosdr.org/en/downloads).~~

- Extension: [Download DuckDuckLib](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckducklib/)

- related: [Firefox data collection policy](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection) 

### DuckDuckGo

The point of the extension is to facilitate web searching via [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com), so their internet vacuums and information dispensing machines will have access to your information as required to conduct that.

## Third parties whose involvement is optional and                                    ancillary to search function

### GitHub

#### Website hosting: GitHub Pages🎣

The website [DuckDuckLib.github.io](https://DuckDuckLib.github.io) is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Link: [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement) (jump to: [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages))

To the best of my knowledge no [Third party applications](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#third-party-applications) are being employed.

🎣 *Only applies while you are actively using this website. DuckDuckLib extension has no direct business with GitHub Pages.*

#### Project & repo services: GitHub🎣

In addition to the website, GitHub hosts the back end project stuff for DuckDuckLib and the website. For clarity, that would be:

- DuckDuckLib Extension Repository: [DuckDuckLib / duckduckLib](https://github.com/DuckDuckLib/duckduckLib)  
- DuckDuckLib Website/Documentation Repository: [DuckDuckLib / DuckDuckLib.github.io](https://github.com/DuckDuckLib/DuckDuckLib.github.io)
- Project organization: [DuckDuckLib](https://github.com/DuckDuckLib)

If you cruise around on the GitHub website, then it's up to GitHub what data they are collecting.

🎣*Only applies while you are actively using their website. DuckDuckLib extension has no direct business with GitHub.*

### Website components: MkDocs

This website is created principally by means of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site generator, possibly with official or community-created plugins. Building the website is handled on my personal computer and the finished pages are upload to the webserver (GitHub Pages, see elsewhere in this document). 

Right now, the site is in actively development, and furthermore, I am trying to learn how to use this software, which is a bit challenging. Therefor I am not certain how it will end up, and what might get tried along the way. Here is a hopefully (but not certainly) exhaustive list of possibilities:

- [MkDocs Plugins · mkdocs/mkdocs Wiki](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Plugins) ([alternate link](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Plugins))
- [lukasgeiter/mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin: An MkDocs plugin that simplifies configuring page titles and their order](https://github.com/lukasgeiter/mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin/)
- [MkDocs Recipes](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Recipes)
- [MkDocs Themes](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Themes)        

Technical information about plugins are put together: [Plugins - MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/)

- also: [Event Based Plugin API](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/Event-Based-Plugin-API)
- also: [Loaders Based Plugin API](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/Loaders-Based-Plugin-API)

#### Third Party Plugins installed

n/a

#### MkDocs

I do not *believe* there is any actual interaction between users of this extension or website and MkDocs, even when users are on the website. Nevertheless I did attempt to find a relevant statement in the MkDocs website, github, wiki, and some apparently closely related projects. The best I was able to do was [mkdocs / mkdocs.](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs): 

> Everyone interacting in the MkDocs project's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the [PyPA Code of Conduct](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct/).
