## What is it?

DuckDuckLib Firefox extension that allows the user to search [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) in a way  which is identical to the usual DuckDuckGo search with two exceptions:

1. **"Safe search" is disabled.** This is the main point of the extension. There will be one less algorithm deciding for you what is appropriate viewing. 
   Of course you may always use the [Safe Search page](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/1997d19d5e21f9806280a3c4895c46f9b075d8d8eb246a85c63cc8c6fef2c2eb/https%3A//safe.duckduckgo.com/) or change the settings on a per-search basis if for some reason you want this function. Read [about safe search](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/0dbfb7e6a0fed574bb3d2938bc613c99b000268d5294dcd2ee24d7a118e418dd/https%3A//help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/features/safe-search/).
2. **Region-specific results are disabled**. Can be enabled on a per-search basis. Read [about regional search](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/27a3865536d6c9a00ba22c3a41393e11f093517caf29e490050a42650fc2192f/https%3A//help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/settings/regions/).

You do not need this extension to accomplish either of these goals. It is merely a convenience.
